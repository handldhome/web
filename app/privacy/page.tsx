        </p>

        <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg text-navy mt-6 mb-2">Right to Limit Use of Your Personal Information for Targeted Advertising</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          You can ask us not to use or disclose your personal information for targeted advertising. Even if
          you opt out of targeted advertising, we will continue to collect and use data for other purposes.
          We do not use or disclose for targeted advertising for personal information of individuals we know
          to be children as defined by applicable law.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          You can tell us not to &quot;sell&quot; your personal information or limit the use of your personal information

          or Share My Personal Information&quot; link in the footers of our websites or settings menus of our apps.
          Our Services also respond to Global Privacy Control signals where appropriate.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          We do not use or disclose personal information for profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce
          legal or similarly significant effects on you without either your explicit consent or where otherwise
          permitted by applicable law.
        </p>

        <h2 className="font-serif text-2xl text-navy mt-10 mb-4">How to Exercise Your Rights</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Visit our Privacy Center to exercise your rights specified under your state&apos;s laws. You can also
          contact us toll free at <strong>1-866-324-3637</strong> or TTY: use 711 and an agent will assist
          you with submitting a request.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          When you submit a request, we will usually ask you to provide an email address to verify your identity
          and prevent fraud. You may also designate an authorized agent to submit a request on your behalf.
          Depending on the nature of the request, we may authenticate the request, such as by requiring a signed
          written permission from you that authorizes the agent to act on your behalf. A valid power of attorney
          will constitute signed written permission, but you are not required to obtain a power of attorney to
          use an authorized agent.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          If you are the parent or guardian of a minor child, you may also submit a request on behalf of your
          child. In that event, we will ask you to provide your child&apos;s email address and to submit a signed
          form authorizing us to proceed with the request regarding your child&apos;s personal information.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          If we deny your request or cannot fulfill it, you may appeal our decision by contacting us via{" "}
          <a href="mailto:Concierge@HandldHome.com" className="text-brandBlue underline hover:text-navy">
            Concierge@HandldHome.com
          </a>{" "}
          to ask us to review your request again. Your email should include &quot;Appeal&quot; in the subject line.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment if you exercise any of the rights explained
          in this US State Supplement.

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          California law defines the term &quot;sale&quot; very broadly. It includes the disclosure of personal information
          in exchange for anything of value. The term &quot;sharing&quot; is defined as disclosure of personal information
          for personalized advertising which is based on a consumer&apos;s information obtained from the consumer&apos;s
          activity across non-affiliated websites.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">

          <li>Inferences, such as audience segmentation</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          In the past 12 months, we have sold or shared each of the categories of personal information listed

          law) your personal information by visiting our Data Sell and Share Opt-out page or clicking the &quot;Do Not
          Sell or Share My Personal Information&quot; link in the footers of our websites or settings menus of our apps.
          Our Services also respond to Global Privacy Control signals where appropriate.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg text-navy mt-6 mb-2">Right to Know Categories of Information</h3>

        <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg text-navy mt-6 mb-2">Retention of Information</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          We retain personal information we collect only for so long as reasonably needed to fulfill the purposes
          for which we collected it. We use reasonable business criteria to establish retention periods for personal
          information. For example, if you register on our Services, we will store your personal information for as
          long as needed to maintain your account, fulfill your requests, enforce any applicable terms that govern
          your use of the Services, maintain appropriate records of the above, or as otherwise required by law.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg text-navy mt-6 mb-2">Right to Delete for Users Under 18</h3>
